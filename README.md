# detect-lookalike-domains
This list will help you generate lookalike domain names. All that is left is to do, is to pass the domain name through your validator. Validate the who is data and then only show the customer the lookalike domains that are currently online. 
#Packages 
The package installed is whois21, run pip3 install whois21
#tld commented out
The whois21 only works with .com,net and edu so the other tld were commented out. If you find a better who is library and would like to apply it. Uncomment out the tld and apply it. Change the check domain page.
#No error handling yet
I have not done error handling nor have I trimmed down the information gotten by the who is. These will be done in a later release.
